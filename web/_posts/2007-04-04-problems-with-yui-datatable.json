Feedback like yours is critical to the library and exactly why we make these early betas available. We appreciate you taking the time, and we're listening.</p><p>You've touched on a few issues which I'll address in order:</p><p>issues with sorting;<br>issues with fixed widths, resizable columns and scrolling (\"header freeze\");<br>and issues with rearrangable columns and endless scrolling (pagination) features.</p><p>Regarding sorting, DataTable currently sorts strings, numbers, and dates, but <em>only when the values are already those types in JavaScript</em>. In contrast, if you get values over the wire (&lt;abbr title=\"XMLHttpRequest\"&gt;XHR&lt;/abbr&gt;), DataTable will treat all values as strings in those cases. As a workaround, you could implement a custom sort function to do the data type conversion. Data parsed from markup will be typed correctly, and so we're a part of the way there; before we get out of beta we plan to provide a mechanism so a value can be treated as a specific type regardless of its origin. I can tell you that in the next release (coming soon) we'll have a hook for you to do your own conversion of data coming over &lt;abbr title=\"XMLHttpRequest\"&gt;XHR&lt;/abbr&gt;, and in the subsequent release it will do a lot of conversions for you out of the box and also provide a mechanism for you to do more sophisticated custom conversions.</p><p>Column widths, table widths, resizability, and scrolling features all work when used individually, but have problems (as you documented) when used together.  By initially focusing on each feature in isolation, we can refine and optimize architecture and APIs with the most freedom. This leeway is important during a true pre-release beta period. Before we come out of beta we'll have a cohesive feature set.</p><p>The third class of features you mentioned includes endless scrolling (dynamic pagination) and rearrangable columns. These aren't self-contained DataTable features but rather collaborations with other YUI utilities. For example the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\">DragDrop</a> utility will enable columns to be reordered. Before we wire up these higher-order features we hope to stabilize DataTable itself. Look for these two features (and a few others) post-beta. We'll try to do a better job communicating plans like this in the future.</p><p>Again, thank you sincerely for helping improve the YUI library. We're definitely listening to you and the entire community.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Nate</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461487","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-04-10T20:21:00Z","author":"admin","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Thanks for the reply Nate.  In the documentation regarding <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/#basicsort\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/#basicsort\">sorting</a>, there is a type attribute you can set on the column headers.  I had assumed that this would cast your variable into the appropriate type prior to sorting.  Good to know that it respects the native types for now.</p><p>I did decide to stick with the lightweight YUI grid for my project, and it is working pretty well so far.  It will be nice to see when you guys get all the kinks worked out.</p><p>PS: I saw your talk at AjaxWorld last October, I learned some good stuff about Yahoo's client side development practices.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461490","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-04-19T23:40:19Z","author":"Zach Leatherman","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Just for those visiting the page to read about the DataTable, this article was written with respect to YUI version 2.2.0, and I have yet to test some of the features above with the newer versions.

Setup row highlighting, put a subscription to the click event and a keylistener for the [enter] key, then perhaps you could edit in a YUI panel or something. As long as you are listening for a doubleclick and enter, you'll be able to implement this. Then when done editing, close the panel and return focus to the datatable....</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461498","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-07-24T16:22:57Z","author":"Pankaj","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4c1dd36a4b6c44c69fd4f951837f07f?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Hi,<br>can you please provide me an example, in which paging is implemented and on every click the data comes from the database rather than just a simple data.js file</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461500","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-07-26T03:46:36Z","author":"Zach Leatherman","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Hey Pankaj, that sounds like a better question for the YUI Developer Mailing List.</p><p><a href=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-javascript/\">http://tech.groups.yahoo.co...</a></p><p>Sounds like your use case is possible.
