I've been developing web pages professionally for 16 years, and assuming people knew waaay more about it than me for ... 16 years. Recently I've started posting some tutorials and the response has been amazing. Turns out I know a bunch of stuff, and there's a whole ton of people who don't know it, and want to know it, and really appreciate when people like me share their knowledge. Maybe soon I'll convince myself to do a talk!</p>","replies":[{"postId":"1076473824","parentPostId":"1076278825","date":"2013-10-09T16:40:29Z","author":"zachleat","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Yeah!
