It reminds me of (the now defunct, I just learned) FollowCost[1], which was valuable in seeing how annoying somebody will be *before* you follow them.</p><p>I keep pretty tight reigns on my Twitter stream for some of the same reasons that you do, and Busyness can definitely help with that.</p><p>The one criticism I have of the tool is that my results didn't surprise me at all. Perhaps it's because I pay close attention to Twitter and I know which of the people I follow tweet the most. Regardless, it served to reenforce my intuition.</p><p>Oh, and that brogrammer joke is almost *too* good.

Much fewer API calls there. I might steal their last 100 tweets idea.</p><p>(At least 20% of the reason I wanted to build this was a desire to use that joke.)</p>","replies":[]}]},{"postId":"922338530","parentPostId":null,"date":"2013-06-07T16:01:43Z","author":"Mike Taylor","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ac20f1159c0ffced0ffeb0ffee6a310?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>This is super cool, thanks guys! It actually helped me find some accounts that I forgot I was following--because they haven't tweeted in years (e.g., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reddit_prog\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://twitter.com/reddit_prog\">https://twitter.com/reddit_...</a>, my 2nd busiest result... heh).</p>","replies":[]}]}}
