Most of the _quick win_ font loading advice I‚Äôm seeing right now (and some [that I give out](/web/23-minutes/)) involves combining `preload` and the `font-display` CSS descriptor.

Just to level-set, `preload` is a way to trigger your web font requests sooner, putting them higher in the network request waterfall. `font-display` is a way to declaratively control your font loading behavior by adding a descriptor to your `@font-face` block.

Lately, I‚Äôve seen a few developers recommend `font-display: optional`. `font-display: optional` puts your web fonts on the back burner and only renders them on repeat primed-cache visits. It‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable method if web fonts are lower on the priority list for your use case‚Äôs requirements. For the record, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of `optional` because I like to at least attempt to render web fonts on an empty-cache visit. _Caveat: in [‚ÄúThe Compromise,‚Äù](/web/the-compromise/) `font-display: optional` is emulated for browsers that do not support the CSS Font Loading API, a method to start moving away from using font loading polyfills for modern browsers._

However, after seeing some confusion on Twitter, I think it‚Äôs probably worth noting that if you decide to use `font-display: optional`, it would be a waste of your page‚Äôs resources to also use `preload`. It won‚Äôt break anything, it‚Äôll just trigger that web font request early (causing network congestion if you have other critical path resources that need to be fetched). An early request won‚Äôt buy you much if the web fonts aren‚Äôt going to render when they finish.

* `preload` with `font-display: optional`: Not great ‚ö†Ô∏è
* `preload` with `font-display: swap`: Good ‚úÖ
* `preload` with `font-display: fallback`: Good ‚úÖ
* `font-display: block` with anything: Bad üö´

Hope that clears up some of the confusion!
