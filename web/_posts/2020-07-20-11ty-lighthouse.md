Continuing in the great web performance tradition of running Lighthouse on so many things that Lighthouseâ€”in shared traits with quarantined pandemic lifeâ€”begins to have no meaning and rampant nihilism washes over the developer ecosystem, I have added Lighthouse scores to the [Starter Projects list on the Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/).

As the Eleventy ecosystem has grown, the list of starter projects available has grown as well. This should help aid new developers if they want to use a Starter Project, as well as highlight developers that have put the extra effort into their projectâ€™s performance and accessibility.

## Adding Scores to Eleventy Docs

Just looking back at the last four months, this certainly feels like the accumulation of a bunch of different side projects coming together. Here are the different projects at work:

* [`performance-leaderboard`](https://github.com/zachleat/performance-leaderboard/)
* [Eleventy Leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/leaderboard/)
* [Speedlify](https://www.speedlify.dev/) with the [API](https://www.speedlify.dev/api/urls.json)
* [`<speedlify-score>`](https://github.com/zachleat/speedlify-score/)
* [Eleventy Cache Assets](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-cache-assets)

### Step 1: Add the URLs

First I manually compiled a list of starter project demo URLs to [Speedlify, a site I built for automated Lighthouse testing and reporting](/web/speedlify/). This was very straightforward based on the work Iâ€™ve already completed. You can see the daily updated results of that here:

<div class="primarylink"><a href="https://www.speedlify.dev/eleventy-starters/">Speedlify for Eleventy Starter Projects</a></div>

### Step 2: Fetch the Data

For my personal website, [I added Lighthouse scores to the footer](/web/lighthouse-in-footer/) using a client-side request to the Speedlify API. That wouldnâ€™t work hereâ€”at time of writing there are 18 starter projects. I wouldnâ€™t want 18 requests to the Speedlify API on every page load! So I modified my [Eleventy data request to fetch and cache the API data at build time](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/blob/master/_data/speedlify.js).

<div class="primarylink"><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/">Eleventy Starter Projects with Lighthouse Scores</a></div>

The Eleventy documentation already runs every day. Coupled with Speedlifyâ€™s daily updates, this means that the scores on the Eleventy documentation will automatically update with new Lighthouse score results every day too. So if a Starter Project author wants to update their project to improve their scores, it requires no manual intervention from me for the scores to update! Jamstack is pretty cool yâ€™all.

### Step 3: Render the Data

Next, I modified the [`<speedlify-score>` web component](https://github.com/zachleat/speedlify-score/) to render build-time-fetched API data. In markup it looks like this:

```html
<speedlify-score raw-data='{"url":"https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/","timestamp":1595170952102,"ranks":{"hundos":7,"performance":5,"accessibility":6},"lighthouse":{"version":"6.1.1","performance":1,"accessibility":1,"bestPractices":1,"seo":0.97,"total":397},"firstContentfulPaint":815.225,"speedIndex":815.225,"largestContentfulPaint":815.225,"totalBlockingTime":0,"cumulativeLayoutShift":0,"timeToInteractive":815.225,"maxPotentialFirstInputDelay":16,"timeToFirstByte":29.860000000000014,"weight":{"summary":"3 requests â€¢ 3 KiB","total":3258,"image":0,"imageCount":0,"script":0,"scriptCount":0,"document":1059,"font":0,"fontCount":0,"stylesheet":2199,"stylesheetCount":2,"thirdParty":0,"thirdPartyCount":0},"axe":{"passes":130,"violations":0}}'></speedlify-score>
```

It doesnâ€™t seem great to render JSON in a data attribute like that but thatâ€™s how it works for now ðŸ™ƒ.

So weâ€™ve eliminated the runtime requests to the Speedlify APIâ€”great!

The next logical step is to build-time render the component so that there isnâ€™t any client-side JavaScript used at all ðŸ˜…. I think that exploration has the potential to yield some very interesting Eleventy/Web Component crossover findings. My initial thought is to use a JavaScript class that you can consume in Node via `require` or `import`, in the browser via `import` or via a web component interface.

## The Final Boss

The final boss-level stage here is to get all of the Built With Eleventy sites onto Speedlify so that anyone can consume the Speedlify API results and put a Lighthouse score widget on their web site. That work is already underway. The logistics of running ~350 sites in Speedlify adds another level of complexity here but it should be achievable. Stay tuned.
