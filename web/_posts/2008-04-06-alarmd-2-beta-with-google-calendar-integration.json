So, the change event doesn't fire all the time in IE when the actual checkbox is clicked?  Turns out if you put a click handler on the actual checkbox, the click event for the checkbox fires even when you click on the label.  Useful information for the future, I suppose.</p><p>Anyway, I fixed it up real nice.  I also fixed a minor display bug that put the options button in the middle of the screen on IE if you didn't have any alarms.</p><p>Now I gotta work on my YSlow score for this thing :P</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461758","parentPostId":null,"date":"2008-04-11T08:57:23Z","author":"Zach Leatherman","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Log:<br>Outstanding bug in IE6: CSS will stay attached to elements on the page even when the stylesheet has been removed.
