## Monday June 10

* [Remy Sharp reminded us that that Disqusâ€™ JavaScript is a trojan horse for all kinds of tracking and fourth-party JavaScript](https://twitter.com/rem/status/1138111172048248832). Notably a lot of this is [blocked by default in Firefox (without an ad-blocker)](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1138127857119584256). Firefoxâ€™s site performance gets a huge head start on Chrome because of Mozillaâ€™s excellent decision to block this extra junk.
* [`core-js` decided to console log a message on postinstall to ask for project donations](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/548) and spurred a big discussion on best practices for open source sustainability. I empathize with what theyâ€™re trying to do but I think the execution was a bit offâ€”Iâ€™ve seen this message in my console so many times that itâ€™s feeling a bit like spam.
* Ryan Frazier is using [Eleventy to render sheet music](https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/lilypond-in-markdown/)! WHAT.
* The [JS Party episode that I was on](https://changelog.com/jsparty/79) was published.
* I wrote a post about [Facepile image performance and lazy loading webmention avatar images](https://www.zachleat.com/web/facepile/).

## Tuesday June 11

* I finally got a little bit of time to play with Nuxt. Iâ€™m becoming a big fan of Vue and it works great but goodness Nuxt loads a fair bit of JavaScript for the Hello World demo.
* I switched my site to use `brotli` instead of `zopfli` compression. Iâ€™d take a wild guess that itâ€™s about 10% better? Hereâ€™s [how I did it](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/commit/4e8f33e3ca55b16df5268721098224f1021b1bb3).
* Update: Remy Sharp removed Disqus from his site and blogged about it in [Ejecting Disqus](https://remysharp.com/2019/06/11/ejecting-disqus). He replaced it with [Commento](https://commento.io/).

## Wednesday June 12

* I found an XSS problem in my webmentions. I needed to adjust my use of sanitize-html in my build to make sure that it was escaping all of the webmention output. Max Boeck updated his [`eleventy-webmentions`](https://github.com/maxboeck/eleventy-webmentions/) project with this fix as well.

## Thursday June 13

* I did a [Smashing TV Webinar](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-tv/five-whys-of-web-font-loading-performance/). It was an updated version (a minor release) of a talk that I gave at [Performance.now()](/web/five-whys/) last year. I published the [new, updated slides](/web/smashingtv/). The video is free to Smashing members!
* We (Filament Group) launched [a redesign of our web site](https://www.filamentgroup.com/)! [Scott Jehl has more about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottjehl/status/1138899549840392197). (Still using Eleventy ðŸ˜Ž)
* [Phil Hawksworth](https://www.hawksworx.com/) did a big update to his very popular [Eleventy starter project, EleventyOne](https://eleventyone.netlify.com/). Itâ€™s great! [_(via Twitter)_](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth/status/1139136281563283457)

## Friday June 14

* I noticed that the much renowned photographer [Norman Posselt](https://normanposselt.com/) published an [Instagram sneak preview of the portrait](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByPXtDWC4m1/) he took of me directly after my talk at Beyond Tellerrand!
* New awesome Eleventy site: [Every Layout: Relearn CSS Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) from [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.design/).
* Another new awesome Eleventy site: [ffconf.org](https://ffconf.org/), a very popular long-running conference series organized by Left Logic. Thanks [Remy Sharp](https://remysharp.com/)!
