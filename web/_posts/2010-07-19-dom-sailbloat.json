The extension system for Firebug Lite is yet experimental and your feedback is very important. I'm planning to include some kind of UI control (probably a menu) so you can load any plugin directly from the UI, a kind of a plugin gallery inside Firebug Lite itself. I still need to define how exactly the plugin will be packed, distributed and automatically updated. And of course... we need more documentation.</p><p>Feel yourself invited to join our discussion list and participate on the design discussions for the extension system.</p><p>Also, if you manage to create a reproducible test case which illustrates the loading problem you're having, please post a report in our issue tracker and I'll fix it.</p>","replies":[]}]}}
