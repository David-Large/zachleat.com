If Google decides to <strong>distribute</strong> code as part of a new package in either binary or source form, and that product uses or extends the YUI lib, then they'll have to include the attribution.</p><p>AFAIK, that's how the BSD license works. (Of course, me !== IP lawyer.) But of course attribution is friendly, and a definite \"good karma\" kind of thing in all cases.  And it's rather cool that Google is using our open-source tools; the YUI folks should be flattered.</p><p>I'm a much bigger fan of the WTFPL for public open-source software, myself ;)<br><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wik...</a></p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461528","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-04-10T22:17:19Z","author":"서준원","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d10ca8d11301c2f4993ac2279ce4b930?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Hey updong.<br>It was surprised about KR posting in here. hehe</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461529","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-04-10T22:50:55Z","author":"Chris DiBona","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7431466c05a0225c7299125b7e6691c0?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Technically, it is not distribution to put bsd code on a webpage even though that page is 'downloaded' to a webclient.

What restrictions are placed on use under the BSD license, if any?</p><p>I hope that my misinterpretation of the license isn't deemed sensationalist, I really just thought it was interesting that YUI code was on the Google homepage.
