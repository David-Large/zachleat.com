The code is only getting the first location the hardware is able to return. Sometimes it is very accurate. Other times, the first given location is well off target, such as the nearest cell tower. I've found it may be a better user experience to use 'navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()' and let the user decide when to accept the given location. Of course this all depends on what you are trying to do.</p><p>I hope this helps someone as much as reading this post about deferred helps me.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887462085","parentPostId":null,"date":"2011-11-09T03:00:17Z","author":"Paul Irish","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6cfbd373bb1dd5f26c066c1fc7e68288?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>There's a proposal for adding deferreds to ES.Next fwiw <a href=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:deferred_functions\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:deferred_functions\">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/...</a></p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887462083","parentPostId":null,"date":"2011-12-01T01:54:41Z","author":"Zach Leatherman","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>@Tom: There is a \"enableHighAccuracy\" option, did you try that? <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#high-accuracy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#high-accuracy\">http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/s...</a></p><p>@Paul: Ah, cool!
