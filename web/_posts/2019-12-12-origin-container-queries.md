Container Queries are an often requested feature of the web platform. It has become almost clich√© to mention it when talking about problems we‚Äôd like the web platform to solve. Container Queries would go a long way toward helping web developers do their jobs better and its omission is a huge limitation when developing component-based code for the web.

Everyone wants it, but it sure seems like no one is actively working on it. But I‚Äôm not here to soapbox about that. Here I only mean to discover the earliest mention of Container Queries (or Element Queries or any implementations of this similar idea) to learn _how long_ this feature has been requested by web developers. I‚Äôm curious: is this length of time customary for a new feature of the web platform? Or is something else going on?

Here are the earliest mentions of Container Queries that the community was able to dig up (in reverse chronological order):

Andy Hume‚Äôs work, thus far, seems to be the original! If you have others that pre-date 2014 (even if they aren‚Äôt before Andy‚Äôs), please [reply to this tweet](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1204488622386417665).

The first large-scale [Responsive Web Design project at the Boston Globe](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/introducing-the-new-responsive-designed-bostonglobecom.html) was launched _after container queries were planted_ <span class="timeago" data-date="9 Sep 2011 00:00:00 GMT">{{ "9 Sep 2011 00:00:00 GMT" | timePosted }}</span> ago on September 9, 2011. The Boston Globe launch further planted the seeds for [responsive image approaches](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-images/) that would result in web browser implementations of both `<img srcset>` and `<picture>` just three years later in 2014.

In conclusion, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
