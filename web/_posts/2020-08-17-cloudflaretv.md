_I log all of my speaking to my website. This post has no video to watch as no video is available—sorry!_

I had a lovely time chatting with [{% imgavatar "jessperate" %}Jess Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/jessperate) about Netlify’s [1 Million Developers](https://million-devs.netlify.com/) microsite, which I’ve [written a little bit about already](/web/1mdevs/).

It doesn’t look like Cloudflare TV posted the video though, but if they do will show up here:
