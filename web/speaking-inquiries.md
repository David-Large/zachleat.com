So you’ve reviewed my [past speaking experience](/web/speaking/) and decided that I might be a good fit to speak at your event—how exciting!

As a [long time conference organizer](/web/nejsconf/), I know that organizing can be very difficult work. Thank you for what you’re doing. Building a community is the most important and undervalued part of a long term investment in well-rounded citizens pushing a positive influence on the web at large.

As such, I keep a certain set of personal guidelines that I hold myself accountable to when agreeing to speak at a conference.

* Travel and lodging must be paid for _every speaker_ that is traveling to the conference. I’ve seen behind the curtain. I know the economics of conferences. This should be the first item in the budget.
* Speaker diversity must be a priority.
