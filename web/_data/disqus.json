Feedback like yours is critical to the library and exactly why we make these early betas available. We appreciate you taking the time, and we're listening.</p><p>You've touched on a few issues which I'll address in order:</p><p>issues with sorting;<br>issues with fixed widths, resizable columns and scrolling (\"header freeze\");<br>and issues with rearrangable columns and endless scrolling (pagination) features.</p><p>Regarding sorting, DataTable currently sorts strings, numbers, and dates, but <em>only when the values are already those types in JavaScript</em>. In contrast, if you get values over the wire (&lt;abbr title=\"XMLHttpRequest\"&gt;XHR&lt;/abbr&gt;), DataTable will treat all values as strings in those cases. As a workaround, you could implement a custom sort function to do the data type conversion. Data parsed from markup will be typed correctly, and so we're a part of the way there; before we get out of beta we plan to provide a mechanism so a value can be treated as a specific type regardless of its origin. I can tell you that in the next release (coming soon) we'll have a hook for you to do your own conversion of data coming over &lt;abbr title=\"XMLHttpRequest\"&gt;XHR&lt;/abbr&gt;, and in the subsequent release it will do a lot of conversions for you out of the box and also provide a mechanism for you to do more sophisticated custom conversions.</p><p>Column widths, table widths, resizability, and scrolling features all work when used individually, but have problems (as you documented) when used together.  By initially focusing on each feature in isolation, we can refine and optimize architecture and APIs with the most freedom. This leeway is important during a true pre-release beta period. Before we come out of beta we'll have a cohesive feature set.</p><p>The third class of features you mentioned includes endless scrolling (dynamic pagination) and rearrangable columns. These aren't self-contained DataTable features but rather collaborations with other YUI utilities. For example the <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/\">DragDrop</a> utility will enable columns to be reordered. Before we wire up these higher-order features we hope to stabilize DataTable itself. Look for these two features (and a few others) post-beta. We'll try to do a better job communicating plans like this in the future.</p><p>Again, thank you sincerely for helping improve the YUI library. We're definitely listening to you and the entire community.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Nate</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461487","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-04-10T20:21:00Z","author":"admin","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm","message":"<p>Thanks for the reply Nate.

I had assumed that this would cast your variable into the appropriate type prior to sorting.  Good to know that it respects the native types for now.</p><p>I did decide to stick with the lightweight YUI grid for my project, and it is working pretty well so far.

Many professional sites, especially those developed here at Yahoo, use some kind of build script to concatenate and minify the JS and CSS in order to save bandwidth and requests.</p><p>For example, on <a href=\"http://buzz.yahoo.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://buzz.yahoo.com\">http://buzz.yahoo.com</a> your browser will see one JS and one CSS for every page.

To make better use of the real estate on a display that's considerably wider than it is high, I have Chrome set to display my tabs... you guessed it, along the left-hand side of the browser. Even when it's in full-screen mode with the tabs hidden, I can't rely on hitting the edge for menu selection because I'm browsing on my right-hand monitor. Going too far left puts me on my laptop screen where the coding and the console windows live.</p><p>Another thing I'd note is that the menu targets could be more immediately visible. On first seeing them, I'd assume that only the text was clickable. Moving my cursor up to \"About Zach Leatherman\", I found myself distracted by the fact that there's some clear space turning black under my cursor before I've even reached my intended target, or anything that looks like a target.</p><p>With things that look like buttons (or even bordered boxes), there come user affordances. We expect that something might react when we cross into or over a bordered region. When all there is between areas of white space is a faint grey line, it comes as a surprise.</p><p>Recall also that Fitts' Law has a perceptual feedback basis, and having a large target isn't so useful if it isn't <em>perceivable</em> as a large target. If you find that something doesn't meet your target expectations, it can slow you down - for example, I've seen sites where the background colour of a link changes when you hover over the region it's in, but only the text itself is actually clickable.</p><p>In any case, I hope my unsolicited feedback was useful, or at least interesting.

It describes a new model to unite Fitts and Hick-Hyman laws together (I have a link at the bottom).</p><p>They stated that the use of the Hick-Hyman law is rather low in determining the efficiency of a menu (like the ones in your example).

You could've also seen that it's not what I meant by looking at the source code of <a href=\"http://wimleers.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"wimleers.com\">wimleers.com</a> of course ;)</p><p>The 4 downsides you list are indeed true of the approach you described (but it's not the one I use). With the approach I use, you say only downsides 1, 2 and 4 remain.</p><p>Downside 1 is definitely true, but I accept that trade-off. I'd rather not have to deal with the case of the font not being loaded yet. Plus, inlining critical CSS is tricky to automate, especially in a modular site where only the necessary CSS is loaded. I don't want to have to update my inline critical CSS manually every time I update Drupal modules.</p><p>Downside 2 is also true, but … what I did 4 years ago still works, and still works fast. WOFF2 still has only 54% browser support. I'll just stick with WOFF for now. It also means I'm not embedding the same font in two formats in my CSS file. So, once again a conscious trade-off.</p><p>Downside 4: I think it's better to simply completely avoid ever loading multiple fonts. Stick to a single font. Yes, my site will perhaps look less special, but I think that's okay. I use the font where it matters.</p><p>But you forget to list the downside of the approaches you do recommend: complexity &amp; maintainability. Having fonts in many formats means updating those fonts, and keeping them in sync in each format. WOFF and WOFF2 didn't exist yet when I applied my technique. You have to deal with FOUT.</p><p>I think the technique strikes a nice balance:<br>1. use a single font, with subsetting performed — this makes it very small<br>2. convert it to WOFF (88% browser support currently)<br>3. embed WOFF in CSS as data: URI<br>4. ensure you have as little CSS as possible, and only a single file</p><p>The end result is simple, prevents FOUT altogether, has a single critical resource in the critical path (besides the HTML), and has subsequent sub-second cold load times in Europe, sub-2-second load times in USA, sub-500ms warm load times everywhere.</p><p>So, I think this is a fine solution for non-high-end sites.</p><p>As always: needs differ, compromises need to be made. We can't _always_ look for the absolute best solution. And the absolute best solution is itself usually a compromise, at least in the world of the WWW :)</p><p>(Remember, this is my personal site, not a multi-million-dollar-revenue-generating site.)</p>","replies":[{"postId":"2719860012","parentPostId":"2714921121","date":"2016-06-09T01:48:39Z","author":"zachleat","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm","message":"<p>I hope that the article didn’t come across as calling you out—I have since learned that <a href=\"http://medium.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"medium.com\">medium.com</a> takes a similar approach (except they use quite a few embedded Data URIs).

There is also a chance that session storage and cache will get out of sync: <a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/911388/16903237/8c7de612-4c46-11e6-8059-a04c8f74e9b0.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/911388/16903237/8c7de612-4c46-11e6-8059-a04c8f74e9b0.gif\">https://cloud.githubusercon...</a>.

I removed sessionStorage to prevent FOIT, and FOUT is still there but is less annoying. The only problem will be with narrow fonts. Also instead of relying on sessionStorage I wonder if we can come up with a solution that uses js to determine width of the element, which will be different based on which font was being used to render it at the given moment. That we can find out if we can apply classname to the body earlier.</p>","replies":[{"postId":"2821592462","parentPostId":"2788573252","date":"2016-08-05T02:48:11Z","author":"zachleat","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm","message":"<p>Hey Serge: thank you for your great comment!
