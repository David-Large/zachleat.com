This web site was started in 2007 and was originally titled **Web 3.0, 6 Bladed Razors, and 7 Minute Abs**.

![Web 367](/web/img/web367.png)

It is written and curated by **Zach Leatherman**, a Professional Front End Engineer working for the [Filament Group](https://github.com/filamentgroup). View his [résumé][2].

*The views expressed on this website do not necessarily represent the views of his employer.*

 > On the web there is often more than one way to solve problems of code and usability. It isn't sufficient to simply find a solution, you must discover the solution that balances often conflicting goals of accessibility, device independence, performance, usability, aesthetics, and future compatibility.

He enjoys watching and playing soccer, piano, finding patterns in both people and machines, movies that make him think or feel, [ordinary things in faraway places][4], and writing about himself in the third person.

He enjoys spending time with his beautiful wife Traci and their two Great Danes, [Roxie](http://packlove.com/roxie) and [Ella](http://packlove.com/133-ella). They also have a cat, a rabbit, goldfish, and probably one or more tarantulas. Check out their [Vacation Blog][6].

Zach trusts his spam filters. He’s had his e-mail in plaintext here since he started this website, so that you have an easy way to contact him. Feel free to do so, at your leisure.

This entry, like Mr. Leatherman himself, is a work in progress.
