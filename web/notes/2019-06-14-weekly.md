## Monday June 10

* [Remy Sharp reminded us that that Disqus’ JavaScript is a trojan horse for all kinds of tracking and fourth-party JavaScript](https://twitter.com/rem/status/1138111172048248832). Notably a lot of this is [blocked by default in Firefox (without an ad-blocker)](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1138127857119584256). Firefox’s site performance gets a huge head start on Chrome because of Mozilla’s excellent decision to block this extra junk.
* [`core-js` decided to console log a message on postinstall to ask for project donations](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/548) and spurred a big discussion on best practices for open source sustainability.
* Ryan Frazier is using [Eleventy to render sheet music](https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/lilypond-in-markdown/)!
* The [JS Party episode I was on](https://changelog.com/jsparty/79) was published.
* I wrote a post about [Facepile image performance and lazy loading webmention avatar images](https://www.zachleat.com/web/facepile/).

## Tuesday June 11

* I finally got a little bit of time to play with Nuxt.
* I switched my site to use `brotli` instead of `zopfli` compression. I’d take a wild guess that it’s about 10% better? Here’s [how I did it](https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/commit/4e8f33e3ca55b16df5268721098224f1021b1bb3).
* Update: Remy Sharp removed Disqus from his site and blogged about it in [Ejecting Disqus](https://remysharp.com/2019/06/11/ejecting-disqus). He replaced it with [Commento](https://commento.io/).

## Wednesday June 12

* I found an XSS problem in my webmentions. I needed to adjust my use of sanitize-html in my build to make sure that it was escaping all of the output.
