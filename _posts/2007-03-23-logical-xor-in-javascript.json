It is obvious from the code, no XOR implementation can return early (inside the loop), as the result of the XOR _always_ depends on all the input bits. This is the reason why it is used in checksums.</p><p>xor(1,0,1,1) should yield true, your implementation yields false.</p><p>Please remove the page or fix it.</p>","replies":[{"postId":"3614673181","parentPostId":"3601993539","date":"2017-11-13T23:12:05Z","author":"zachleat","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Filed here <a href=\"https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/issues/14\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://github.com/zachleat/zachleat.com/issues/14\">https://github.com/zachleat...</a></p>","replies":[]}]}]}}
