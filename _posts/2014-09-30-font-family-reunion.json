I expected that because the machine has to check each font name in the list until it finds one that is available, it would add extra time. However, the results I got were pretty inconclusive. This may have been because I was testing on a pretty new MacBook Pro (crazy fast), or because I didn't know the exact piece of the timeline to look for. However, the font stack was the only variable that changed in an otherwise very simple page, so the lack of a noticeable delay was surprising.</p><p>@zachleat Do you know if a bloated font stack (such as your Arial, etc example) has any real negative impact, aside from the few extra characters in the CSS?</p>","replies":[{"postId":"1844327528","parentPostId":"1842762959","date":"2015-02-09T20:26:39Z","author":"zachleat","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>I’m not sure, but I’m also not sure this is a performance problem you’d see in the real world?
