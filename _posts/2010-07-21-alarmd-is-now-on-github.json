Similarly, +#s just seems to fail, but +#h works for hours.  Works fine if I spell it out or use other abbreviations (e.g., +1min).  This is different from before, as you can see of the alt tag when you hover over \"Single Easy Alarm\", might want to change it if the problem occurs for anyone else?</p><p>Thanks for the program, btw, I love it and use it constantly!</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"1551392181","parentPostId":null,"date":"2014-08-20T16:25:10Z","author":"Ricardo","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/827102fa6492cc13307679717585302d?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>I'm new here loved your article!
