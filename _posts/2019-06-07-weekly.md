## Chromium Edge and FOIT

With Edge‚Äôs move to a [new Chromium-based build](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/), Microsoft‚Äôs long defense of FOUT (visible fallback text for web fonts) as a default behavior is changing.

Per sources (the lovely Greg Whitworth), this default [may change back](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1129253642220052480) if feedback dictates. But we‚Äôre gaining something in this trade, too. When the default changes, support for the `font-display` descriptor comes with it which will allow us to customize this behavior in Edge as needed.

I‚Äôll wait to update [A Historical Look at FOUT and FOIT](/web/fout-foit-history/) after a stable version of Chromium Edge is released.

## JS Party!

I was on [JS Party last week](https://twitter.com/JSPartyFM/status/1134127789257449472) to talk about web font loading and Eleventy! I was really excited to do this because it was the first legitimate time I got to talk about Eleventy in a public forum üòé. Also it felt really comfortable talking to NEJS CONF co-organizer [Nick Nisi](https://twitter.com/nicknisi) and former speaker [Divya Sasidharan](https://twitter.com/shortdiv). Look for the episode to be published soon!

## Top 3 Blog Posts


1. Andrew Betts has another very important post on AMP: [Cake or Death: AMP and the Worrying Power Dynamics of the Web](https://trib.tv/2019/05/28/cake-or-death-amp-and-the-worrying-power-dynamics-of-the-web/). Make sure you stick around for the footnote.
> ‚ÄúThe web is open and decentralised. We spend a lot of time valuing the first of these concepts, but almost none trying to defend the second.‚Äù
2. I absolutely devoured every word of this post from one of the maintainers of Babel, Henry Zhu: [(Open) source of anxiety](https://increment.com/open-source/open-source-of-anxiety/). Not that Eleventy has seen any measure of popularity on a Babel scale (and honestly, I hope it never does), maintenance of maintainers is an important thing to discuss.
3. [Self-Host Your Static Assets](https://csswizardry.com/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/) by Harry Roberts. This discussion comes up every few years (luv u Google Fonts) and I think Harry nails it down here: if you want speed, self host.

## Email development

I‚Äôve been doing a bit of HTML email dev this week and it‚Äôs been frustrating. Look, I was around for IE6. I was doing heavy JavaScript coding in the IE7 days. I felt real _relief_ when IE8 came out. But this is a whole new level of pain.

If it isn‚Äôt the email clients that will burn you, it‚Äôs the tooling around them. The micromanagement of testing tools: Litmus, pain; Email on Acid, pain. Everything is pain.

## The Watchlist

To be frank I‚Äôm not a big talk-video watcher (I consider this a failing, not a strength) but here are the two from this week that I‚Äôm really looking forward to consuming:

1. [The economics of open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO8hZlgK5zc) by C J Silverio at JSConf EU 2019. [C J](https://twitter.com/ceejbot) is the former CTO of npm and shared a stage at the same conference on the same day with the person at npm that fired them. Courageous. [Related Twitter search: #npmlayoffs](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23npmlayoffs&src=typd)
2. [The World-Wide Work](https://newadventuresconf.com/2019/coverage/ethan/) by Ethan Marcotte at New Adventures 2019. By all accounts this may be the most important talk of the year. Certainly not going to miss this one.

## Addendum, in Passing üí®

* Soon you‚Äôll be able to [download fonts on the Apple App Store](https://twitter.com/NickSherman/status/1135644308189540352). Related [post by Matthew Rechs](https://www.bizlet.org/writings/why-ios-fonts-matter) (former head of Adobe TypeKit)
