Tried adding event listeners to close the expansion before changing the page, to no avail. The next page shows a blank line and when you click the blank line it disappears, and then the clicking gets funky for the rest until you just refresh. So I imagine I might still have the problem while using an ajax based pagination as well.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461693","parentPostId":null,"date":"2008-11-06T15:57:19Z","author":"Miguel Angel","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56bed2b67ff1fa39fb87feee1820b803?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Hello, great job, but I have a question, I'm trying to add another yui table when the row expands, but I can't, somebody knows how make this possible?<br>thanks</p>","replies":[]}]}}
