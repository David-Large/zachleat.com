I think your point about namespacing is well-taken, but the YAHOO.namespace() function is non-destructive. If you were already using YAHOO.tool, then YAHOO.namespace() won't overwrite the existing one so all of your functionality will be safe.</p><p>By the way, where's your contact information? I'd like to have an offline conversation sometime. Stop by my site and drop me a line when you have a second.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461679","parentPostId":null,"date":"2008-08-08T17:02:52Z","author":"Tom Te","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5a708e925cf26437c874f4bbc5262bb?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Are you sure your jQuery namespace function works?
