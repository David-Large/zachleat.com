Here is an article from a journal that states \"go to top\" links are useful for screenreader usability:<br><a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1011736\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1011736\">http://portal.acm.org/citat...</a><br>(If you do not have ACM access, you can find a full version of the article via Google).</p><p>For most users, you are right. The links are irrelevant. My suggestion is to incorporate the links in aesthetically so they do not interfere with any of the primary tasks of sighted users.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461925","parentPostId":null,"date":"2011-09-04T03:26:50Z","author":"Andrew","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68e9acaccdf7a8c802c233984223c68b?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>I'm pretty sure I've never clicked a \"back to top\" link in the 8 years I've been using the internet, so I agree with your post.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"967980307","parentPostId":null,"date":"2013-07-19T00:27:51Z","author":"Geoff","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6512c8b15243cd8188cdfcf966e552d4?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>I disagree. What if you have a super-long page and the user doesn't want to scroll for 10 seconds to get back to the top, or even drag the scrollbar?</p><p>Then what's easier, clicking a button, mouse-wheel scrolling, or click-and-dragging the scrollbar?</p><p>You could argue that one could use [HOME] button on the keyboard, but hardly anyone knows about that these days.
