I was looking all over the net for something like this, and it was a PERFECT fit!</p><p>Of course, I'd love some more features :) Please please please add: <br>1) Support for nested function - OO-style. If there's a class MyClass and a function MyFunction, it would be awesome if you displayed it like \"MyClass.MyFunction\"<br>2) Click to navigate to the definition of the function. Firebug already has a great code browser, it would be amazing to be able to click on a function name in your plugin and go directly to the place in code where it's defined.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461537","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-06-14T14:09:28Z","author":"Aravind","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31b0db35576a41d98356828967bfb06d?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Hi,</p><p>I have a requirement (may be strange) as follows:</p><p>- Execute blackbox test cases using GUI<br>- Hopefully, there is a tool that can record all my actions while I execute blackbox test and play back.<br>- The tool should be able to export the recorded instructions as HTTPUNIT tests.<br>- I need in particular HTTPUNIT or any other tests basically to see the code coverage of JSP/JAVA files.</p><p>Is there anything for this?<br>Please help</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461539","parentPostId":null,"date":"2007-08-06T16:38:40Z","author":"Elephant","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed8dd8ad09199c54815ef543da4b7263?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>Cool extension.
