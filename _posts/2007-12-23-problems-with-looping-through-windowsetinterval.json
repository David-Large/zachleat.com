Using setInterval will cause your internal function to execute once every 100 milliseconds. And will add <em>lots</em> of time stamps to the array.</p>","replies":[]},{"postId":"887461729","parentPostId":null,"date":"2008-01-17T07:08:09Z","author":"Zach Leatherman","avatar":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e1899004c71c7043343196103e210be3?d=mm&s=60","message":"<p>I meant to use setInterval.  Using the for loop above, I should have my internal payload function execute in 3 separate 1 second interval timers.  So every second, I should get 3 entries added into the r array.  But, I'm getting 9 entries added every second, which is confusing to me.  There should be only 3 timers, not 9.</p>","replies":[]}]}}
