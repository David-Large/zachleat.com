This is a blog about web development, not just as a commercial item that can be upgraded with another blade, or a workout that can be shortened by one minute. It is something that empowers people to share information on the world wide web, to collaborate in ways that werenâ€™t possible before. People are changing the world from their own living rooms. How are you contributing?

This blog is written by [**Zach Leatherman**][1] (zachleat). Feel free to [read more about Zach][2].
